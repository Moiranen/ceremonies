Herald
: The occasion is always joyous when we gather together. However, the occasion is doubly blessed when we can also enjoy a special display of beauty and art. Therefore was created the Order of the Dragon's Bowle, to be given at the Crown's discretion to those gentles whose care, attention and artfulness in equipping themselves enhances the spirit of the event to the delight of all.

And so do their Majesties call before them ____________ .
