title: 8. The Order of the Dragon's Tear

Herald
: Whenever members of the Kingdom gather to fight or dance, revel or conduct business, there are responsibilities which fall to the hosts so that all may enjoy the event. It sometimes happens, however, that a heavy burden falls upon a single individual or small group, so that a great number of people might find special enjoyment.

Thus was created the Order of the Dragon's Tear, for those worthy souls who, as event stewards, overcome special difficulties or provide a particularly enriching experience for the populace. And these gentles shall be known by a teardrop-shaped pendant worn on a cord in the colours of Drachenwald.

Now therefore do their Majesties call before them ____________ .
