title: 11. The Order of the Dragon's Pride

Herald
: The reward of artistic achievement and scientific knowledge is a joyful duty for the Crown, as the product of such labour brings delight to all who are touched by it; but when the skill resides in one of tender years, the joy is especially great, since the Crown rewards not only the work itself, but the promise of greater things to come.

Therefore was created the Order of the Dragon's Pride, to reward artistic or philosophic achievement in a young member of the people.

And so do their Majesties call before them ____________ .
