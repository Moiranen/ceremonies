title: Part IV Business Checklist
---

This is not a mandatory list, but considering each item for inclusion will help ensure all potential business has been considered. Different items can be intertwined.

* Awards and Orders (usually ordered with lowest precedence first, but be flexible). A peerage is usually the last piece of business of a court, whether that be invocation or elevation.
* Children.
* Those for whom it is their first court [in Drachenwald] (near the end of court).
* The business of other royalty present.
* Guild business.
* Tournaments and competition proclamations and results.
* Event Steward & staff.
* Head Cook & staff.
* Oaths of Fealty (peerages, officers, personal).
* Inductions into positions of fealty or office.
* Interludes (music, poetry, stories, etc.). Not a good idea in already long courts.
* Ambassadors
* Anyone who has requested time for other business.
