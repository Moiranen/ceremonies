title: Part I Introduction
---

The Drachenwald Book of Ceremonies was originally compiled by Mistress Adelaide de Beaumont, then Schwarzdrachen Herald, as a part of the project of Drachenwald becoming a Kingdom. Ten years later, Marcus and Anna, then Crown Prince and Princess, commissioned a revision of the ceremony and oaths for their coronation, and this led to an updated Second Edition of the entire book. A third edition was produced when the Order of Defence became a fourth order of bestowed peerage.

This fourth edition has been created for a couple of reasons. The first is to include the new grant level awards of the Orders of the Ring. The second is to take into account that a ruling couple may no longer be one man and one woman, but two of the same or that they or a recipient/candidate may not consider themselves as either.

While new editions of the Book of Ceremonies have only been published once a decade, one should keep in mind that a book like this is by its nature a work in progress: new ceremonies appear and old ones are changed as needed. However, most changes that happen over the years are minor, and this is as it should be. Ceremonies are one of the fundamental aspects of this Society, and while it is possible to change them, this should be done slowly and with reverence.

Nevertheless, while the standard ceremonies change relatively little over time, there is room for alternate ceremonies and oaths. There is a companion volume to this Book that includes such additional material; more would be welcome.

In terms of practical heralding, it is also permitted to drop parts of ceremonies where this may prove advantageous. When you are aware that a court will be long, you will do yourself and the Crown more favour by being as succinct as possible rather than reading the introduction to each and every order or award being presented.
