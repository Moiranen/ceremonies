title: Part XI Award of Arms Level Awards
---

There is no formal ceremony for giving a plain Award of Arms. The normal method is for the person to be called to the Royal presence; the Crown then has the opportunity to talk about the accomplishments of the person, after which the herald reads the scroll and calls for vivats.

Bear in mind that awarding arms is specific to certain places and times within period. It is acceptable to substitute an equivalent type of ceremony and scroll to suit the recipient's persona.

The three armigerous orders listed here rank above a plain Award of Arms, and if the recipient has not already got an Award of Arms it comes by Kingdom law automatically with the membership in the order. In such a case, this should be proclaimed at court, for example by reading the scroll that mentions the fact explicitly.

It is traditional for the existing members of an Order to make themselves known, either by being called forward, or more commonly as they increase in size, by simply standing in place. Neither is mandatory, and an easy win when faced with a long court is to omit this part.
