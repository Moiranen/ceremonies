title: 13. The Order of the Hospitallers of Albion

Herald
: There are times when the Crown of Drachenwald travels to distant lands either to stand with other kingdoms on the field of battle, fighting injustice and defending the weak, or for the pleasure to be gained from foreign travels where the beauty of the Known World may be experienced and enjoyed. During these travels, the Crown is sometimes aided and supported by gentles of those foreign lands, whose sacrifice on behalf of our Crown may be great indeed.

Therefore was created the Order of the Hospitallers of Albion, to reward and thank those gentles or groups who, while not subjects of Drachenwald, have shown unselfish service to our Kingdom and its Crown during these travels.

And so do their Majesties call before them ____________
