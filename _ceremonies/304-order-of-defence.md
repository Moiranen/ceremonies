title: 4. Order of Defence

*** Invocation of the Vigil ***

Herald
: Their Majesties command the presence of all members of the Order of Defence.

_The order comes forward._

Monarch
: Good my Peers, We seek counsel! Will you give us this?

Order
: Yes.

Monarch
: Word has reached us that there is one amongst Our people who is a Peer in truth, but not in name. Is this so?

Order
: Yes.

Monarch
: Let us summon the candidate.

Herald
: Their Majesties command the presence of __________________.	

Monarch
: __________, your skill with arms is known to us, your virtues beyond reproach. It is our wish to make you a member of the Order of Defence.

Herald / Sponsor / Senior Defender
: It is necessary that I address you, concerning aspects of Peerage, Courtesy and the Scholarship of Defence. It is often said that Peerage is an honour. It is surely that - but more, it is a responsibility, which you should not take upon yourself lightly, but with sobriety and sincerity. The oaths you will be offered will bind you in fealty to the Crown; and it is well that you should understand what you are about to promise.

_The next paragraph may be read by a Member of the Pelican:_

The Order of the Pelican is the order of Service, and yet, a Master of Defence must serve as well: not only the Crown, but the land as a whole, each companion of the Defence performing to the best of their ability, and then to that point of performance where sacrifice is required. A Peer must be ready and willing to do good works, and must do them more frequently and more extensively than their friends who are not Peers.

_The next paragraph may be read by a Member of the Laurel:_

The Order of the Laurel is the order of the Arts and Sciences. The Art of Defence may be the defining one for a swordmaster, but he too must endorse and encourage the full field of Arts and Sciences, not only by appreciating, but by participating in their practice, for what the skills of a swordmaster might win may be made barren and cold by the combat itself; only the warm heart can nurture the land and its people and bring them to their fullest potential. Heed well the example of teaching from the Companions of the Laurel, as that is the very art that in addition to your own you will require to fully achieve the estate of a mastery.

_The next paragraph may be read by a Member of the Chivalry:_

The Knights and the Masters of Arms are the Order of Chivalry, but no less chivalrous behaviour will be expected of you. As a Peer of the Realm you must endeavour to live, as you have until now, by the rules of courtesy and gentle behaviour. The courtly ideal is your guide in your conduct with others, whether they be fellow Peers, or the humblest of the populace; for indeed, the lowlier the station of those with whom you treat, the greater is your influence over them. Deal with them justly and fairly, regardless of station, be gracious and courteous to all, be an example to whom others can look.

_Return to the Herald / Sponsor / Senior Defender._

The Order of Defence is the order noted for its deadly art and scholarship of weapons. The swordmasters of the order stand as the foremost examples of grace and form, not only in swordsplay but in all manner of courtliness setting the standard of the gentles in our royal courts. A companion of Defence, a swordmaster, must display equal grace in victory and in defeat; he must not suffer injustice, but neither should he seek vengeance; he must remember that as his reputation depends upon his skill in delivering sure thrusts and clever cuts, so it also depends upon the way in which he receives them. Be mindful that a Peer guides, not only by his word, but also by the example he sets for others.

As a swordmaster you need to continue your scholarship and study of not only the Art of Defence and all others of the courtly arts as being a Master is being a scholar who is now responsible for not only his own improvement but of the improvement of others as well. Remember the demands and dictates of courtesy, honour, and chivalry and being true to the Order you are about to enter, defend them by your life, limb and heart, both In fields of combat and halls of our Courts. Teaching the love of them as well as your art to all those who look upon you for guidance.

	To accept elevation to the Peerage is to accept these responsibilities. I pray you, keep these 	words in your heart, as you prepare for your new status.

Monarch
: Good peers, please escort __________________ to their vigil to consider our offer and please give them your guidance and council in this matter.

*** Induction to the Order of Defence ***

Herald
: Their Majesties command the presence of the Members of the Order of Defence.

_Members of the Order assemble._

Herald
: It has long been recognized that not only in the tournament combat and melee, but in the study and practice of the Art of Defence as well, is the true strength and prowess of the Kingdom forged. Since times of antiquity has this art been practised, honed and taught by those first amongst the swordsmen who have dedicated themselves to pursuit of the mastery of steel. A number of these also possess the virtues we expect and demand from the peers of our Society, they are much deserving of our recognition and tribute, not only by their skills with true edge of steel, but their nobility of heart, grace of their manner and service to our realms as whole.

Therefore was created the Order of Defence, the fourth Order of the Society bearing a Patent of Arms and ranking equally with the Orders of Chivalry, Laurel and Pelican, to be bestowed on the worthiest of our gentles when elevating them to the ranks of Peers of the realm. The Order of Defence exists to recognize those of our Swordsmen, Warriors and Scholars of the Arts of Arms who display not only these but also all other qualities expected from the Peers of the Realm and who by their love of Arts not only that of defence and their service and largesse support these lands and the Crown.

_Herald reads scroll, hands it to Monarch. Monarch hands it to candidate. Monarch receives the collar of the order from the provider, usually a member of the Order. It is appropriate to here relate to the history of the collar, if any. Monarch places the collar around candidate’s neck, as he says the following._

Monarch
: ____________ , take from Our hands this token of your achievement and Our esteem. Henceforth be M___ ____________ .

Monarch
: Let the new M___ be vested as befits their new rank.

_A cloak of the order is placed around the peer's shoulders, while the herald says the following._

Herald
: As a cape defends the body from cold, so defends a Master of Defence the realm and crown. As the cape displays the sign of the Masters' new status as a peer of the realm, underneath it carries the symbol of the Order of the Dragon's Steel so the heritage of the Order of Defence in the lands of Albion would not be forgotten.

The particular sign for a Master of Defence is the white collar of maintenance where the collar's pure colour symbolizes his honour, intentions and aspirations the very name of the garment reminding him how he as a peer, ought to maintain the realm, the crown and our common ideals thus making the crown lighter to bear as he defends our Sovereigns and their realm from all that might wish harm or slurs upon the Golden shields of the Kingdom and Society.

Monarch
: M___ ____________ , is it your wish to swear fealty to us at this time?

Candidate
: ____________

**_If yes:_**

_Monarch receives Sword of State. The new peer places his hands on the sword, the Crowns place their hands upon his hands._

Candidate
: I will.

Herald
: Do you wish to give the Crown such counsel which is to the benefit of them and their Realm, and support them in upholding the laws and fulfilling their coronation oath?

Defence
: I do.

Herald
: And will you keep secret such matters as the Crown wants to keep in confidence, and not divulge such secrets that could harm their Realm?

Defence
: I will.

Monarch
: And We in turn promise to grant you and your household all the rights and privileges of old, and to protect you with the Law of the Realm.
