title: 12. Popular Company of Sojourners

Herald
: Our beloved realm was founded by travellers who came to this land from distant shores and made it their home. We are proud that to this day, travellers still come and abide in our land.

But alas, as travellers come, they also go, and often it is our sad task to bid farewell to those whose path leads them away from Drachenwald. It is especially sad when those travellers have served the Kingdom well and become beloved of the people.

Thus was created the Popular Company of Sojourners, to recognise those who leave Drachenwald the richer for their time here.

And so do their Majesties call before them ____________
