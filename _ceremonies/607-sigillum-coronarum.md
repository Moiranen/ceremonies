title: 7. Sigilla Coronarum
---

*** By both Sovereign and Consort together ***

Herald
: The duties and responsibilities of the Crown are many. Our Sovereign by blood must be a source of strength and wisdom for the people. They must be foremost in valour upon the battlefield, yet gentlest in courtesy of any in the Realm. Their Consort must be a patron of artists and philosophers. They must be the embodiment of gentle grace, courtesy, virtue and love that her subjects deserve. Together, as one, they must govern and rule this land.

: Although our Sovereigns are supported by all loyal subjects whose service they may command, there are those subjects without whom they could not rule half so joyously, for their constant attention to Royal needs makes light the day-to-day details of ruling and their tireless devotion serves to ease the burden of Royal responsibilities.

: Therefore was created the Sigillum Coronae, to recognise those individuals, whose personal service to the Crown far exceeds any expected measure. And the badge of the award shall be a white Edelweiss surmounted by a black dragon's head bearing the sigils of the Crown bestowing it.

: So now do their Majesties call before them ____________ .
