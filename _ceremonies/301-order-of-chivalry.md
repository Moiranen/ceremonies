*** Invocation of the Vigil ****

Herald
: Their Majesties command the presence of all members of the Order of Chivalry.

_The order comes forward._

Monarch
: Good my Peers, We seek counsel! Will you give us this?

Order
: Yes.

Monarch
: Word has reached us that there is one amongst our people who is a Peer in truth, but not in name. Is this so?

Order
: Yes.

Monarch
: Let us summon the candidate.

Herald
: Their Majesties command the presence of __________________.	

Monarch
: __________, your skill with arms is known to us, your virtues beyond reproach. It is our wish to make you a member of the Order of Chivalry.

Herald / Sponsor / Senior Chivalry
: It is necessary that I address you, concerning aspects of Peerage and Chivalry. It is often said that Peerage is an honour. It is surely that, but further, it is a responsibility, which you should not take upon yourself lightly, but with sobriety and sincerity. The oath you will be offered will bind you in fealty to the Crown; and it is well that you should understand what you are about to promise.

_The next paragraph may be read by a Member of the Pelican:_

The Order of the Pelican is the order of Service, and yet, a Knight and a Master of Arms must serve as well: not only the Crown, but the land as a whole, each member of the Chivalry performing to the best of their ability, and then to that point of performance where sacrifice is required. A Peer must be willing to do good works, and must do then more frequently and more extensively than their friends who are not Peers.

_The next paragraph may be read by a Member of the Laurel:_

The Order of the Laurel is the order of the Arts and Sciences, but a Knight and a Master of Arms must also encourage the Arts and Sciences, not just by appreciating them, but by participating in their practice, for what the strong arm of the warrior wins may be made barren and cold by the battle; only the warm heart can nurture the land and its people and bring them to their fullest potential.

_The next paragraph may be read by a Member of the Defence:_

The Order of Defence is the order noted for its deadly art and scholarship of weapons, but a Knight and a Master of Arms must be equally skilled in diverse arts martial, either on a tourney field or in war, always striving to become more skilled in the arts and practice them with grace, and to teach those willing to learn.

_Return to the Herald / Sponsor / Senior Chivalry_

The Knights and the Masters of Arms are the Order of Chivalry, and as such, they stand as the foremost examples of gentle behaviour, valour, and honour. A member of this Order must display equal grace in victory and in defeat; he must not suffer injustice, but neither should he seek vengeance; he must remember that as his reputation depends upon his skill in delivering blows, so it also depends upon the way in which he receives them. Be mindful that a Peer guides, not only by his word, but also by the example he sets for others. Continue to live by the Code of Chivalry: to protect the weak and defenceless; to respect and defend the honour of ladies; and to teach these values to others that may seek the true standard of Chivalry. The Code is your guide in your conduct with others, whether they be fellow Peers, or the humblest member of the populace; for indeed, the lowlier the station of those with whom you treat, the greater is your influence over them. Deal with them justly and fairly, regardless of station, be gracious and courteous to all, be an example to whom others can look.

To accept elevation to the Peerage is to accept these responsibilities. I pray you, keep these words in your heart, as you prepare for your new status.

Monarch
: Good peers, please escort __________________ to their vigil to consider 	our offer and please give them your guidance and counsel in this matter.

*** Induction into the Order of Chivalry ***

Herald
: Their Majesties command the presence of the Chivalry.

_Members of the Order assemble._

Herald
: Since ancient times it has been recognised that there are certain warriors who are much deserving of high honour, not only by their skill at arms, but by their noble behaviour, which has come to define the meaning of Chivalry.

Therefore was created the Order of the Chivalry, to recognise those who, possessing all the other skills, virtues and attributes appropriate to members of the Peerage, shall also have distinguished themselves by their prowess in armoured combat and chivalrous demeanour. The Order consists of two equal parts, Knights and Masters of Arms.

And the symbols of Knighthood are a white belt and an unadorned chain, while the symbol of Mastery of Arms is a white baldric. The white belt and baldric betoken the honour with which the knight or master girds himself, and the chain the fealty the knight swears. And this Order ranks in precedence with the Orders of the Laurel, the Pelican, and Defence. It carries with it a Patent of Arms.

Escort
: Your Majesties, having consulted with the Order, is it your desire to increase our numbers at this time?

Monarch
: It is. Please bring the candidate forward.

_Escort brings candidate forward._

Escort
: My liege, it is my privilege to present you ____________ , that they may be made a member of our order.

_At this point it is possible to have members of the peerage orders to speak for the candidate:_

Herald
: Not only the arts of Ssordmanship and eye of measure but also the strength of arm and chivalry of heart make one a true warrior. Order of Chivalry stands as primary of these attributes.

Monarch
: Is there a member of the Order of the Chivalry to speak for the candidate?

Knight / Master of Arms
: _Speaks about the chivalry and prowess in arms of the candidate._

Herald
: But whilst Force of Arms may defend a Realm, it does not make it flourish. Without the Arts and Sciences, the land is bare and barren. The Order of the Laurel is the Order of the Arts and Sciences. But to appreciate what they fight for, a member of the Chivalry must have knowledge of the Arts and Sciences.

Monarch
: Is there a member of the Order of the Laurel to speak for the candidate?

Laurel
: _Speaks of the candidate in respect to their accomplishments in / appreciation of arts and sciences._

Herald
: No matter the greatness of the Warrior or the Artisan, without Service, they remain isolated, shared not with the Realm. The Order of the Pelican is the Order of Service, but a member of the Chivalry must also serve the Crown and the Realm.

Monarch
: Is there a member of the Order of the Pelican to speak for the candidate?

Pelican
: _Speaks of the service done by the candidate._

Herald
: By all manner of arms and combat the Kingdom is defended and championed. While the Order of Defence is the Order of Steel, Swordsmanship and Art of Arms, a member of the Chivalry is also a keen student and teacher of these arts.

Monarch
: Is there a member of the Order of Defence to speak for the candidate?

Defence
: _Speaks of the candidate’s long dedication, skill and inspiration in the arts of combat and of his grace in field and court_

Monarch
: Is there a member of the Order of the Rose to speak for the candidate?

Herald
: A warrior may be mighty, but without courtesy and honour they are no Peer. The Order of the Rose speaks for courtesy and honour.

Rose
: _Speaks of the courtesy of the candidate._

Herald
: Drachenwald has many Peers, but many more who are not Peers, and their voice is mighty, to be ignored at the peril of all! Is there a message from the People of the Realm in regard to this candidate?

**Representative of the populace
: _Speaks of the largesse, humility or fairness the candidate exhibits in how he interacts with the rest of the society._

_Crown turns to the sponsor._

Monarch
: Do you, Sir/M___ ____________ , and the other members of your order affirm their worthiness for this high honour, accepting them as your peer in chivalry, honour and valour upon the field?

Knights
: I do.

Monarch
: It is our judgement that the candidate fulfils all the requirements of the Order of Chivalry.

Monarch
: ____________ , well pleased with your prowess on the field and your gentle conduct at all the times, responsive to the wishes of your peers, we are minded to create you a member of the Order of Chivalry. Will you accept from us this honour?

Candidate
: I will, Your Majesty.

Monarch
: Do you wish us to create you a Knight, and swear fealty to us, or would you rather become a M___ of Arms?

Candidate
: ____________

Monarch
: Make known Our Royal will.

_Herald reads scroll, hands it to Monarch. Monarch hands it to candidate._

*** **In case the candidate opts for Knighthood ***
: Monarch
: Let the candidate's sword be brought forward.

_The candidate' sponsor girds the candidate with the sword belt. During this, the Crown adds the following words._

Monarch
: Remain forever worthy of this sword ____________ , and bear in mind that a sword has two edges, Justice and Mercy.

Monarch
: Let the candidate be vested with his spurs.

_A member of the Chivalry puts the spurs on the candidate._

Herald
: Be mindful that a knight guides, not only by his word, but also by the example he sets for others. Continue to live by the Code of Chivalry: protect the weak and defenceless, respect and defend the honour of ladies and teach these values to others that may seek the true standard of knighthood.

Monarch
: With what sword do you wish to be knighted?

_Candidate answers, e.g. Sword of State, Sponsor's sword, etc.. Monarch receives the named sword and if the Crown is not a knight, the sponsor moves around to the right of the throne and lays his hand over the Crown’s. The candidate is struck with the flat side, once on the right shoulder, once on the left and then once on the top of head. During this, a Crown says the following._

Monarch
: I dub thee once, I dub thee twice, I name thee Knight!

_Pause._

Sir ____________ , let this be the last blow you receive without giving answer.

_Crown delivers the buffet, preferably to the right shoulder, firmly but not injuriously. The buffet may be left out completely if the candidate has strong hesitations. The other Crown, if present, receives the white belt and girds the knight with it._

Monarch
: Wear this belt, Sir ____________ , and keep it as you would your honour, unblemished and unstained.

_Crown receives Sword of State. Knight places his hands on the sword, The Crowns place their hands upon knight's hands._

Herald
: Will you hold ____________ and ____________ your rightful Sovereigns, right until the end of their lawful reign, and support their royal might and justice?

Knight
: I will.

Herald
: Do you wish to give the Crown such counsel which is to the benefit of them and their Realm, and support them in upholding the laws and fulfilling their coronation oath?

Knight
: I do.

Herald
: And will you keep secret such matters as the Crown wants to keep in confidence, and not divulge such secrets that could harm their Realm?

Knight
: I will.

Monarch
: And We in turn promise to grant you and your household all the rights and privileges of old, and to protect you with the law of the Realm.

_The candidate' sponsor girds the candidate with the sword belt. During this, the Crown adds the following words._

Monarch
: Remain forever worthy of this sword ____________ , and bear in mind that a sword has two edges, Justice and Mercy.

Monarch
: Let the candidate be vested with his spurs.

_A member of the Chivalry puts the spurs on the candidate._

Herald
: Be mindful that a Master of Arms guides, not only by his word, but also by the example he sets for others. Continue to live by the Code of Chivalry: protect the weak and defenceless, respect and defend the honour of ladies and teach these values to others that may seek the true standard of Chivalry.
