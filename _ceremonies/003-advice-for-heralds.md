title: Part III Advice for Heralds
---

* When you wear their Majesties' tabard, you do more than just represent them, you speak **as** them. What you do reflects directly upon them. You should act as they would. Remember however, that when their Majesties ask you to do something in their name, you are their voice. It can sometimes be daunting to ask, or even instruct, those who would normally be of higher rank and experience within the Society than you. As their Majesties herald, though, you act with their authority.
* Advise their Majesties honestly, on tradition, on what is period, on how best to accomplish something. In the end though, the final decision is theirs.
* Know the space in which you will be presiding. This applies to such things as obstacles, compactness, acoustics, light levels, etc.
* You do not have to do everything within court yourself. Delegate to others. Small jobs, such as the reading of a scroll, can be good starting points for those wishing to gain experience in the business of court heraldry.
* Make sure the court has the physical items necessary. Tables, not just for royalty, but for business items and your drink. Chairs not just for their Majesties, but also for any with business in court who are infirm. A chair is also often appreciated by those receiving a peerage as it is a long ceremony and one they should enjoy rather than getting sore knees.
* Receiving an award is often an emotional experience. Give the recipient time to take it in.
* As far as possible make sure newcomers know that they will be called up and know what to do. Ideally they should be called after they’ve had a chance to observe more experienced members. They will be unsure and unfamiliar, amongst people they don’t know.
* Always place a drink for yourself in the court before it starts.
* **Vivat** is for one person, **vivant** for more than one.
