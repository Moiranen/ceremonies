title: 1. Creation of a Pursuivant or Herald
---

_In theory any noble, singly or as a couple, can appoint their own herald._

Herald
: Know that We _____________ [and _____________ ], _____________ [and _____________] of _____________ , have need of a pursuivant / herald to carry our messages in peace and war, to be our voice, and to teach the noble arts of heraldry. Know also that hearing good report of our faithful servant _____________ as a gentle(wo)man skilled in the arts of honour we are minded to appoint them as our Pursuivant / Herald [Extraordinary].

In witness thereof we call forth all and any members of the College of Heralds here present and direct them to present _____________ before Us!

_The heralds come forward, escorting the candidate, and stand aside._

Herald
: Do you _____________ , of your own free will, swear to serve __________ [and __________] as pursuivant / herald?

Candidate
: ________

**_If swearing:_**

Herald
: You shall swear by the faith that you owe to the _Lords / Barons / Princes / Sovereigns_ whose arms you shall bear, that you shall truly keep such things as are comprised in the articles following:

_Following each of the articles, the candidate responds “I so swear”._

**_If not swearing:_**

Herald
: By the faith that you owe to the _Lords / Barons / Princes / Sovereigns_ whose arms you shallbear, you shall truly keep such things as are comprised in the articles following:

Herald
: First, you shall be true to our high and most excellent _Lords / Barons / Princes / Sovereigns_ that they are, and to them that make you a herald. And if you should have any knowledge or hear any imagination of treason, you shall discover it to them or to their noble council; and counsel it in no manner.

You shall be serviceable to all gentle persons to do their commandments to their worship of noble deeds; and to excuse their worship by your good counsel, and ever ready to offer your service to them.

You shall be secret and keep the secrets of knights, squires, ladies, gentlewomen, and all manner of gentle folk; a confessor of arms; and not discover them in any wise except treason aforesaid.

If you be in any place where you hear debate or peril between two gentles which you be privy to, if so be it that you be required by prince, judge, or any other to bear witness, you shall not be without license of both parties, and when you have leave, you shall not testify for any good favour or awe, but say the truth to your knowledge.

**_If investing a Kingdom, Principality or Regional Herald_**

You shall pursue learning, and teach officers of arms under you, all manner of things pertaining to nobility.

You shall forsake all places of dishonesty and hazard and dishonestly going to common taverns and places of debates and all manner of vices, and take to virtues as much as you are able.

**_If swearing_ (_Be aware of the potential religious sensitivities of this action. It may be omitted.)_**

Herald
: These articles you have sworn truly to keep with all your might and power.

_An attendant moves forward and gives the goblet of water to the appointing noble who slowly pours a bit of water from the goblet over the candidate's head while speaking these words:_

**_If swearing_**

**Presiding noble
: Then, by your oath, I do create you pursuivant / herald by the name of _____________ . As you shall serve Us as pursuivant / herald, We shall reward you with largesse.

**_If not swearing_**

**Presiding noble
: I hereby create you pursuivant / herald by the name of _____________ . As you shall serve Us as pursuivant / herald, We shall reward you with largesse.

_Sovereign/Baron gives the cup to the candidate._

**_If creating a Pursuivant_**

Herald
: Let the pursuivant be invested with his tabard of office, and let him wear it athwart as befits his rank of pursuivant, and in no other way.

_Attendents move forward and put a tabard on the candidate. The tabard should be put on so that the arms of the tabard are on the candidate's chest and the front and back drape over the candidate's shoulders and arms._

**_If creating a Herald_**

Herald
: Let the herald be invested with his tabard of office and let him wear it so that he may be known as a herald.

_Attendants move forward and put a tabard over the head of the candidate so that it is athwart. Then, in a separate and obvious motion, the tabard is turned so that it is worn properly. If the candidate was already wearing a tabard athwart then the attendants turn the tabard so that it is worn properly._

**Presiding Noble
: Arise, _____________ , and go forth.

_The herald exhorts cheers from the populace._
