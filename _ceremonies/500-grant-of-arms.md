title: Part X Grant of Arms Level Awards
---

Court Note: **Ring and Wing sound almost identical in English, especially in the probably imperfect acoustics of a court. Sometimes the entire Ring may be addressed and others just those of the Wing. Make sure that it is very clear which is being referred to. I, Nicholas, have in the past already been caught out once by mishearing this in court.

There is no formal ceremony for giving a plain Grant of Arms. The normal method is for the person to be called to the Royal presence; the Crown then has the opportunity to talk about the accomplishments of the person, after which the herald reads the scroll and calls for vivats.

Bear in mind that granting arms is specific to certain places and times within period. It is acceptable to substitute an equivalent type of ceremony and scroll to suit the recipient's persona.

The three grant level orders listed here rank above a plain Grant of Arms, and if the recipient has not already got a Grant of Arms it comes by Kingdom law automatically with the membership in the order. In such a case, this should be proclaimed at court, for example by reading the scroll that mentions the fact explicitly.

It is traditional for the existing members of an Order to make themselves known, either by being called forward, or more commonly as they increase in size, by simply standing in place. Neither is mandatory, and an easy win when faced with a long court is to omit this part.

In some Kingdoms it is traditional to style gentles with a grant of arns as Honorable Lord/Lady. This is not an official title of the SCA, and whilst not officially recognised within Drachenwald, there is no barrier to using this style, especially if the holder or recipient desires it.

Herald
: _This introduction can be dispensed with if time is short._

: Drachenwald is rich with stories of rings. Rings of might, circles of knights and rings of legend: some made by gods of old, others forged by men seeking to build a better world and live by the greatest of ideals. Thus inspired, the rulers of Drachenwald added to this long tradition by creating our Kingdomâ€™s own Order of the Ring, called in Latin, Ordo Annuli. This order is the circle of trust and protection around our Crown, this order is the circle of pillars supporting the thrones and this order is the chaplet of stars resting on the royal brow. The order is one unified circle, composed of three entwined companies of greatness.

: _This ordering is arbitrary, and can be changed as appropriate or just to reinforce that no company is greater than the others._

: The Order of the Swallow, formally called Ordo Hirundinis, whose companions are noted for their service and diligence. The Order of the Swan, formally called Ordo Cygni, whose companions are noted for the grace of their art and philosophy. The Order of the Wing, formally called Ordo Alae, the Crown's allies in deeds of arms, noted for their prowess and courage.

: _For longer courts, depending on which orders are being presented, and in what order, it may expedient to call upon the entire Order of the Ring, or just the Company specifically involved._

Herald
: _Be very clear here, where required, to distinguish between 'Ring' and 'Wing', hence why including the Latin form is a good idea._

: Their Majesties call forth all companions of Ordo Annuli, the Order of the Ring, to bear witness and stand by them in their following deeds.1

**or**

: Their Majesties bid all companions of Ordo Annuli, the Order of the Ring, to stand or make themselves known to witness their following deeds.

_Substitute a specific order in one of the forms above._

and, through that Company, create/confirm you as a member of the Order of the Ring.

Make known our command.

Herald
: _Reads the scroll text and hands it to the Crown._

_A token appropriate to the company is given to the Crown, either by an attendant or one of the appropriate Company. The Crown then bestows the token._

Monarch
: __________, take from Our hands this token of your achievement and rank, and of Our esteem. Henceforth you are a Companion of the Ring.

Go forth and greet your companions.

Herald
: _Note a pre-existing title may trump that below._

For _[the Honorable]_ Lord/Lady _________. Vivat! Vivat! Vivat!
