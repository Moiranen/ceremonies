title: Part IX Baronies
---

In Drachenwald, baronage, both territorial and of the court, ranks between peerage and grant-level awards. The ceremonies for investing barons and baronesses are accordingly listed in the section of grant-level awards. A Grant of Arms is often given with a court barony, but this is not automatic and so must be explicitly proclaimed at court.
