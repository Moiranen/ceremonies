title: 3. Order of the Pelican

*** Invocation of the Vigil ***

Herald
: Their Majesties command the presence of all members of the Order of the Pelican.

_The order comes forward._

Monarch
: Good my Peers, We seek counsel! Will you give us this?

Order
: Yes.

Monarch
: Word has reached us that there is one amongst Our people who is a Peer in truth, but not in name. Is this so?

Order
: Yes.

Monarch
: Let us summon the candidate.

Herald
: Their Majesties command the presence of __________________.	

Monarch
: My Lord/Lady/other appropriate title, your acts of service and counsel are known to us, your virtues beyond reproach. It is our wish to make you a member of the Order of the Pelican.

Herald / Sponsor / Senior Pelican
: It is necessary that I address you, concerning aspects of the Peerage. It is often said that Peerage is an honour. It is surely that – but more, it is a responsibility, which you should not take upon yourself lightly, but with sobriety and sincerity. The oath you will be offered will bind you in fealty to the Crown; and it is well that you should understand what you are about to promise.

_The next paragraph may be read by a Knight or Master / Mistress of Arms:_

The Knights and the Masters of Arms are the Order of Chivalry, but no less chivalrous behaviour will be expected of you. As a Peer of the Realm you must endeavour to live, as you have until now, by the rules of courtesy and gentle behaviour. This courtly ideal is your guide in your conduct with others, whether they be fellow Peers, or the humblest of the populace; for indeed, the lowlier the station of those with whom you treat, the greater is your influence over them. Deal with them justly and fairly, regardless of station, be gracious and courteous to all, be an example to whom others can look.

_The next paragraph may be read by a Member of the Laurel:_

The Order of the Laurel is the order of the Arts and Sciences, but a Pelican must also encourage the Arts and Sciences, not just by appreciating them, but by participating in their practice, for the greatest service you can render to your Land is to make it whole and harmonious, and devoid of the beauty and braces of Art, that it cannot be.

_The next paragraph may be read by a Member of the Defence:_

The Order of Defence is the order noted for its deadly art and scholarship of weapons, but you too are expected to serve and defend the Crown and their realm with tenacity and grace, and to teach those willing to learn the arts of maintaining this our Society.

_Return to the Herald / Sponsor / Senior Pelican._

The Order of the Pelican is unique among the four orders of Peerage. Every Peer of the Realm, be they of the Order of the Chivalry, Laurel, Defence or Pelican, has the responsibility to serve: not only the Crown, but the land as a whole, each performing to the best of their abilities. But the service expected of a Pelican is far greater than that expected of the other Peers, and greater still than that expected of the populace at large. You must be the first to offer your help, and the last to accept reward; you must not falter when the task becomes more difficult than you anticipated; and you must not remain content with your past accomplishments, for although they are great, and for this reason are you being created a Peer, it is by your future achievements that you will be judged by those who seek to follow the example of a Peer.

To accept elevation to the Peerage is to accept these responsibilities. I pray you, keep these words in your heart, as you prepare for your new status.

Monarch
: Good peers, please escort __________________ to their vigil to consider 	our offer and please give them your guidance and counsel in this matter.

*** Induction to the Order of the Pelican ***

Herald
: Their Majesties command the presence of the Members of the Order of the Pelican.

_Members of the Order assemble._

Herald
: It has long been recognised that there are those among us who are much deserving of high honour, but who, by reason of the nature and direction of their services and achievement, come not to the glory of warrior or throne, yet without whom our land would not be half so blessed.

Therefore was created the Order of the Pelican, to recognise those who, possessing all the other skills, virtues and attributes appropriate to members of the Peerage, shall also have distinguished themselves by their sustained and exemplary service to the Society.

The symbol of this Order is a medallion bearing a Pelican in her Piety, for as we all know, the Pelican will, when necessary, nourish her young with blood from her own breast. Hence, the Pelican has come to represent sacrifice, and become the symbol of the good servant. And this Order ranks in precedence with the Orders of Chivalry, Laurel, and Defence. It carries with it a Patent of Arms.

Escort
: Your Majesties, having consulted with the Order, is it Your desire to increase our numbers at this time?

Monarch
: It is. Please bring the candidate forward.

_Escort brings candidate forward._

Escort
: Your Majesty, it is my privilege, to present____________ , that they may be made a member of our order.

_At this point it is possible to have members of the peerage orders to speak for the candidate:_

Herald
: No matter the greatness of the Warrior or the Artisan, without Service, they remain isolated, shared not with the Realm. The Order of the Pelican is the Order of Service.

Monarch
: Is there a member of the Order of the Pelican to speak for the candidate?

Pelican
: _Speaks of the service done by the candidate._

Herald
: But while service upholds the Realm, it must be done with strength and chivalry. The order of Chivalry stands as primary of these attributes, but they are also required of a member of the Order of the Pelican..

Monarch
: Is there a member of the Order of the Chivalry to speak for the candidate?

Knight
: _Speaks about the chivalry and/or prowess in arms of the candidate._

Herald
: But whilst service may uphold a Realm, it does not make it flourish. Without the Arts and Sciences, the land is bare and barren. The Order of the Laurel is the Order of the Arts and Sciences. But to appreciate why they serve the Kingdom, a member of the Pelican must have knowledge of the Arts and Sciences.

Monarch
: Is there a member of the Order of the Laurel to speak for the candidate?

Laurel
: _Speaks of the candidate in respect to their accomplishments in / appreciation of arts and sciences._

Herald
: The Kingdom is defended and championed in many different ways. While the Order of Defence is the Order of Steel, Swordsmanship and Art of Arms, a member of the Order of the Pelican is also defending the Realm in their own manner.

Monarch
: Is there a member of the Order of Defence to speak for the candidate?

Defence
: _Speaks about the candidate’s grace and long dedication to the kingdom and society._

Herald
: A servant may do great works, but without courtesy and honour they are no Peer. The Order of the Rose speaks for courtesy and honour.

Monarch
: Is there a member of the Order of the Rose to speak for the candidate?

Rose
: _Speaks of the courtesy of the candidate._

Herald
: Drachenwald has many Peers, but many more who are not Peers, and their voice is mighty, to be ignored at the peril of all! Is there a message from the People of the Realm in regard to this candidate?

**Representative of the populace
: _Speaks of the largesse, humility or fairness the candidate exhibits in how they interact with the rest of the society._

_Monarch turns to the sponsor._

Monarch
: Do you, M___ ____________ , and the other members of your order affirm their worthiness for this high honour, accepting them as your peer in service and in the other attributes of peerage?

Pelicans
: I do.

Monarch
: It is our judgement that the candidate fulfils all the requirements of peerage.

Monarch
: ____________ , right mindful of your achievement and service to Our land, and responsive to the wishes of your peers, We are minded to create you a Member of the Pelican. Will you accept from us this honour and the badge of your achievement?

Candidate
: I will, Your Majesty.

Herald
: Will you, to the best of your ability, continue in the cause of service, as you most surely have until now, and seek to increase your labours and talents nobly, and train any dependants you may have to do likewise, so far as it is within your powers?

Candidate
: I will.

Monarch
: Make known our Royal will.

_Herald reads scroll, hands it to Monarch. Monarch hands it to candidate. Monarch receives the medallion from the provider, usually a member of the Order. It is appropriate to here relate to the history of the medallion, if any. Monarch places medallion around candidates neck, as he says the following._

Monarch
: ____________ , take from our hands this token of your achievement and our esteem. Henceforth be M___ ____________ .

Monarch
: Let the new M___ be vested as befits their new rank.

_A cap of maintenance is placed on the new peer's head and a Pelican's cloak is placed around the peer's shoulders, while the herald says the following._

Herald
: Since times immemorial, the cap of maintenance is the symbol of the Pelican, for just as the cap of maintenance supports the crown and makes it easier to bear, so the Pelican supports the Kingdom and eases the burden of its rulers.

The cloak is the outward sign of the Pelican's new status as a peer of the realm.

Monarch
: M___ ____________ , is it your wish to swear fealty to us at this time?

Pelican
: ____________

**_If yes:_**

_Crown receives Sword of State. Pelican places his hands on the sword, The Crowns place their hands upon Pelican's hands._

Herald
: Will you hold ____________ and ____________ your rightful Sovereigns, right until the end of their lawful reign, and support their royal might and justice?

Pelican
: I will.

Herald
: Do you wish to give the Crown such counsel which is to the benefit of them and their Realm, and support them in upholding the laws and fulfilling their coronation oath?

Pelican
: I do.

Herald
: And will you keep secret such matters as the Crown wants to keep in confidence, and not divulge such secrets that could harm their Realm?

Pelican
: I will.

Monarch
: And We in turn promise to grant you and your household all the rights and privileges of old, and to protect you with the Law of the Realm.

So say We ____________ , Rex/Regina

Monarch
