title: 2. Order of the Laurel

*** Invocation of the Vigil ***

Herald
: Their Majesties command the presence of all members of the Order of the Laurel.

_The order comes forward._

Monarch
: Good my Peers, We seek counsel! Will you give us this?

Order
: Yes.

Monarch
: Word has reached us that there is one amongst Our people who is a Peer in truth, but not in name. Is this so?

Order
: Yes.

Monarch
: Let us summon the candidate.

Herald
: Their Majesties command the presence of __________________.	

Monarch
: __________, your skill in the arts and sciences is known to us, your virtues beyond reproach. It is our wish to make you a member of the Order of the Laurel.

Herald / Sponsor / Senior Laurel
: It is necessary that I address you, concerning aspects of the Peerage. It is often said that Peerage is an honour. It is surely that, but more, it is a responsibility, which you should not take upon yourself lightly, but with sobriety and sincerity. The oath you will be offered will bind you in fealty to the Crown; and it is well that you should understand what you are about to promise.

_The next paragraph may be read by a Member of the Chivalry:_

The Knights and the Masters of Arms are the Order of Chivalry, but no less chivalrous behaviour will be expected of you. As a Peer of the Realm you must endeavour to live, as you have until now, by the rules of courtesy and gentle behaviour. This courtly ideal is your guide in your conduct with others, whether they be fellow Peers, or the humblest of the populace; for indeed, the lowlier the station of those with whom you treat, the greater is your influence over them. Deal with them justly and fairly, regardless of station, be gracious and courteous to all, be an example to whom others can look.

_The next paragraph may be read by a Member of the Defence:_

The Order of Defence is the order noted for its deadly art and scholarship of weapons, but you too are expected to apply to your own art and scholarship with tenacity and grace, to defend what is right, and to share your knowledge with those willing to learn.

_The next paragraph may be read by a Member of the Pelican:_

The Order of the Pelican is the order of Service, but each Master and Mistress of the Laurel, too, has the responsibility to serve: not only the Crown, but the land as a whole, each Laurel performing to the best of their ability, and then to that point of performance where sacrifice is required. A Peer must be willing to do good works, and must do then more frequently and more extensively than their friends who are not Peers.

_Return to the Herald / Sponsor / Senior Laurel._

The Order of the Laurel is the Order most noted for artistry and scholarship. Members of the Orders of Chivalry, Pelican, and Defence, as Peers of the Realm, are expected to have some measure of artistic talent or skill, but a Laurel exemplifies this talent to a degree far greater than that of the other Peers, and greater still than that of the populace at large. Rightly or wrongly, a Laurel is taken as an authority, whose words carry considerable weight; do not therefore choose your words lightly. Remember that just as your praise can encourage a young artisan beyond any other force, your censure can crush a budding talent of which the land may, by your actions, forever be deprived.

To accept elevation to the Peerage is to accept these responsibilities. I pray you, keep these words in your heart, as you prepare for your new status.

Monarch
: Good peers, please escort __________________ to their vigil to consider 	our offer and please give them your guidance and counsel in this matter.

*** Induction to the Order of the Laurel ***

Herald
: Their Majesties command the presence of the Members of the Order of the Laurel.

_Members of the Order assemble._

Herald
: It has long been recognised that there are those among us who are much deserving of high honour, but who, by reason of the nature and direction of their services and achievement, come not to the glory of warrior or throne, yet without whom our land would not be half so blessed.

Therefore was created the Order of the Laurel, to recognise those who, possessing all the other skills, virtues and attributes appropriate to members of the Peerage, shall also have distinguished themselves by their outstanding achievement in the Arts and Sciences.

And the symbol of this Order is a medallion bearing a laurel wreath, for the chaplet of laurel has long been acknowledged as a mark of superior achievement, and this Order ranks in precedence with the Orders of Chivalry, the Pelican, and Defence. It carries with it a Patent of Arms.

Escort
: Your Majesties, having consulted with the Order, is it your desire to increase our numbers at this time?

Monarch
: It is. Please bring the candidate forward.

_Escort brings candidate forward._

Escort
: My liege, it is my privilege, to present ____________ , that they may be made a member of our order.

_At this point it is possible to have members of the peerage orders to speak for the candidate:_

Herald
: Without the Arts and Sciences, the land is bare and barren, for only they make the Realm flourish. The Order of the Laurel is the Order of the Arts and Sciences.

Monarch
: Is there a member of the Order of the Laurel to speak for the candidate?

Laurel
: _Speaks of the achievements of the candidate in the arts and sciences._

Herald
: But while the arts and sciences enhance the Realm, it must be fostered by strength and chivalry. The order of Chivalry stands as primary of these attributes, but they are also required of a member of the Order of the Laurel.

Monarch
: Is there a member of the Order of Chivalry to speak for the candidate?

Knight
: _Speaks about the chivalry and/or prowess in arms of the candidate._

Herald
: No matter the greatness of the Artisan or the Warrior, without Service, they remain isolated, shared not with the Realm. The Order of the Pelican is the Order of Service, but a member of the Order of the Laurel must also serve the Crown and the Realm.

Monarch
: Is there a member of the Order of the Pelican to speak for the candidate?

Pelican
: _Speaks of the service done by the candidate._

Herald
: The Kingdom is defended and championed by many different arts. While the Order of Defence is the Order of Steel, Swordsmanship and Art of Arms, a member of the Order of the Laurel is also a keen student and teacher of their own arts.

Monarch
: Is there a member of the Order of Defence to speak for the candidate?

Defence
: _Speaks about the candidateâ€™s grace and long dedication to the art._

Herald
: An artisan may be skilled, but without courtesy and honour they are no Peer. The Order of the Rose speaks for courtesy and honour.

Monarch
: Is there a member of the Order of the Rose to speak for the candidate?

Rose
: _Speaks of the courtesy of the candidate._

Herald
: Drachenwald has many Peers, but many more who are not Peers, and their voice is mighty, to be ignored at the peril of all! Is there a message from the People of the Realm in regard to this candidate?

**Representative of the populace
: _Speaks of the largesse, humility or fairness the candidate exhibits in how he interacts with the rest of the society._

_Monarch turns to the sponsor._

Monarch
: Do you, M___ ____________ , and the other members of your order affirm their worthiness for this high honour, accepting them as your peer in artistic and philosphic endeavour, and the other attributes of peerage?

Laurels
: I do.

Monarch
: It is our judgement that the candidate fulfils all the requirements of peerage and entry into the Order of the Laurel.

Monarch
: ____________ , right mindful of your achievement and service to our land, and responsive to the wishes of your peers, We are minded to create you a M___ of the Laurel. Will you accept from us this honour and this badge of your achievement?

Candidate
: I will, Your Majesty.

Monarch
: Make known Our Royal will.

_Herald reads scroll, hands it to Monarch. Monarch hands it to candidate. Monarch receives the medallion from the provider, usually a member of the Order. It is appropriate to here relate to the history of the medallion, if any. Monarch places medallion around candidates neck, as he says the following._

Monarch
: ____________ , take from our hands this token of your achievement and our esteem. Henceforth be M___ ____________ .

Monarch
: Let the new M___ be vested as befits their new rank.

_A chaplet of laurel leaves is placed on the new peer's head and a Laurel's cloak is placed around the peer's shoulders, while the herald says the following._

Herald
: From ancient times, the chaplet of laurel has been placed on the heads of those worthy of special honour and recognition.

The cloak is the outward sign of the Laurel's new status as a peer of the realm.

Monarch
: M___ ____________ , is it your wish to swear fealty to us at this time?

Laurel
: ____________

**_If yes:_**

_Crown receives Sword of State. Laurel places their hands on the sword, Crowns place their hands upon Laurel's hands._

Herald
: Will you hold ____________ and ____________ your rightful Sovereigns right until the end of their lawful reign, and support their royal might and justice?

Laurel
: I will.

Herald
: Do you wish to give the Crown such counsel which is to the benefit of them and their Realm, and support them in upholding the laws and fulfilling their coronation oath?

Laurel
: I do.

Herald
: Will you keep secret such matters as the Crown wants to keep in confidence, and not divulge such secrets that could harm their Realm?

Laurel
: I will.

Monarch
: And We in turn promise to grant you and your household all the rights and privileges of old, and to protect you with the Law of the Realm.

So say We ____________ , Rex/Regina

Monarch
: So say We ____________ , Rex/Regina.
